A classic Snake game implemented in C++ for Windows console with smooth movement and progressive difficulty.

## üìù Description

This is a traditional Snake game where players control a snake to eat fruits and grow longer. The game features smooth console rendering, progressive difficulty, and screen-wrapping mechanics.

## üåü Features

- Smooth movement with reduced screen flickering
- Dynamic speed adjustment based on snake length
- Score tracking
- Screen wrapping (snake moves through walls)
- Tail collision detection
- ASCII-based graphics

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements

- Windows Operating System
- C++ Compiler (GCC/MinGW or MSVC)
- Windows Console support

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abhishek-Verma0/Cpp-Snake-Game-Console.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd snake-game
```

3. Compile the code:
```bash
g++ snake.cpp -o snake.exe
```

4. Run the game:
```bash
./snake.exe
```

## üéÆ Controls

- `W` - Move Up
- `S` - Move Down
- `A` - Move Left
- `D` - Move Right
- `B` - Quit Game

## üéØ Gameplay

- Control the snake to eat fruits (`F`)
- Each fruit increases score by 5 points
- Snake grows longer with each fruit eaten
- Game ends if snake collides with its own tail
- Snake can pass through walls and appear on the opposite side
- Speed increases as snake grows longer

## üíª Technical Details

The game uses several key components:

### Core Functions
- `Default()`: Game initialization
- `Draw()`: Console rendering
- `Input()`: Player input handling
- `Logic()`: Game mechanics
- `main()`: Game loop

### Key Features
- Double buffering for smooth rendering
- Dynamic speed adjustment
- Collision detection
- Coordinate tracking system

## üîß Customization

You can modify these constants in the code:
```cpp
const int width = 110;  // Game board width
const int heigth = 25;  // Game board height
```

## ANSI CODES
ANSI escape codes are supported on many modern terminal emulators (including Linux and macOS). They allow you to change the text color and background using special character sequences.

    \033[31;40m
1.  `\033` is the escape character (ESC in ASCII).
2. `31` represents red text color.
3. `40` represents black background color.
4. `0m` resets all attributes to default.

- \033[48;5;0m = Black background
- \033[48;5;1m = Red background
\033[48;5;2m = Green background
- \033[48;5;3m = Yellow background
- \033[48;5;4m = Blue background
- \033[48;5;5m = Magenta background
- \033[48;5;6m = Cyan background
- \033[48;5;7m = White background
- \033[48;5;<number>m = 256-color background (where <number> can be between 0 and 255)



## Text Color Setting Using ANSI codes

    "\033[31mThis text is red\033[0m"

1. `\033`: This starts the escape sequence.
2. `[31m`: This sets the text color to red.
3. `[0m:` This resets the color to default.

- 91	Bright Red
- 92	Bright Green
